# LOAD "": Why 48K still matters for digital humanities in 2026

This Xmas, I unearthed my old Spectrum from a polystyrene box of forgotten gear, along with a shoebox full of cassette tapes I hadn't touched in decades. To my surprise, the little machine still whirred to life, its familiar rainbow logo and internal logic still intact. But as I sit here listening to the familiar, chaotic screech of a game trying to load, it strikes me how precarious this bit of history actually is. These tapes aren't just old tapes; they are the primary records of a massive cultural shift that happened in living rooms across both Britain and Spain.

This personal rediscovery has prompted a change in how I intend to approach my 2026 digital humanities cohort. We will be moving beyond the familiar territories of audio, film, and video, leaving abstract theory behind to get stuck into the physical rescue of "orphaned" software. The imperative is to act now, before the magnetic signals on these vintage tapes fade away for good. 

The Spectrum was the heart of 1980s popular culture for a generation of kids—now a demographic of somewhat grumpy men and women, myself included, who have traded our joysticks for reading glasses—who learned to code between school and dinner. In those days, a computer wasn't a sealed, mysterious slab of glass; it was an invitation to tinker, to break things, and to create.

However, preserving that legacy involves much more than just hitting a "save" button on a modern computer. Simple digitisation often misses the point of why this era mattered. Software is also a form of social memory, and if we only save the raw code, we lose the wider story. We lose the "bedroom coder" spirit, the charm of the handwritten tape labels, and the communal experience of sharing games in a pre-internet world where a C60 cassette was the primary currency of cool.

Our task in the upcoming term will be to treat these 8-bit artefacts with proper archival respect. We must acknowledge that the hardware, the loading process, and even the "R Tape Loading Error" are just as important to the historical record as the pixels on the screen. The fact that this vintage kit still works after forty years in a cupboard is a lucky break, but it serves as a sobering reminder that we are the last line of defence for this collective memory. If we don’t document the context now, we aren't just losing games; we are allowing the foundations of our digital lives to simply vanish into the hiss of blank tape.
